      <% if !email.nil? && !email.empty? %> It looks like your public email address is <%= email %>.
      <% else %> It looks like you don't have a public email. That's cool.

      <% if !private_emails.nil? && !private_emails.empty? %>
        With your permission, we were also able to dig up your private email addresses:
        <%= private_emails %>
      <% else %>
        Also, you're a bit secretive about your private email addresses.
      <% end %>
